# What is this?

This is my repository for all of my old java projects and homework. I don't know if they all still work, I don't know if they are corrupted, all I know is that I wrote them when I was like 15 and had no idea what I was doing. Tread with caution.

# How to run?

1. Install Eclipse IDE
2. Clone this repository anywhere you like
3. Import one of these folders into eclipse as a project
4. At this point you may have to do some clicking around and reading the code to figure out which file is the main file
5. Run the main file!
